# Global Proxy

Global Proxy is an Obsidian plugin that makes it easy to configure network proxies and use these proxies throughout Obsidian. Currently supported proxy types include socks, http, and https. It may be needed by users in areas with restricted networks.

### How to Use

Fill in the input boxes with the corresponding proxy address. If all the proxies are invalid, all links will be direct without using a proxy. If both socks and http/https proxies are set, they may be used.
